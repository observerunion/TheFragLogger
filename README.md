Now To Install Fork My Project Then Download The Files As A ZIP File.
Then Install Python On Linux/Termux/Windows
Linux:
`sudo apt-get python`
Termux:
`pkg install python`
Windows: Install Python From https://www.python.org
Then Whenever You're Done Type In Your Shell
`py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
# EXE File
To Make It As A EXE File You Have To Install Pyinstaller/PY2EXE
For This Project I'm Using Pyinstaller
To Install Pyinstaller Type This
`py -m pip install pyinstaller`
Whenever It's Done If Your On Windows Move The PY File To:
Users/(UserName)/AppData/Local/Python/Python39/Scripts And Paste The Script There Then Open CMD In That Folder Then Type In:
`pyinstaller main.py`
For Linux Simply Go To The Script Directory Then Type In:
`pyinstaller main.py`
For Termux It Didn't Work For Me But Here's The Way Put The Files In data/data/com.termux/home When You Do It Type In:
`pip install pyinstaller`
When The Package Is Done Installing Just Type In:
`pyinstaller main.py`
(Please Note: Don't Do It As --onefile That Will Make The Script Totally Unusable)
# Configuration
Just Go To main.py And Put In Your Webhook.
